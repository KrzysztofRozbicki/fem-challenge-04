## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Easy and fast project, very developer friendly , you don`t even have to make a @media query for
desktop version. How to make a hover overlay on < img >. How to make easy transitions on hover.

### Continued development

I have noticed that horizontal phone orientation are destroying the layout. Would like to master
that even if design is not telling you that.
